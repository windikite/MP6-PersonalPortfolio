My 6th mini project! This is a simple portfolio using relatively basic HTML and some CSS to make it look pretty. Some key things it needed:  

1. An about me  
2. A skills section  
3. A projects section  
4. A contact section  

I'm pretty proud of the colors too since I love chocolate and mint. I'm unsure if it's too garish for the web nowadays, but I'm sure it would look nice on geocities at least.
